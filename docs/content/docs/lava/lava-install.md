LAVA install

To get the LAVA binaries reach out to the LAVI team.

Once you acquire the binaries follow the same steps to [install LAVI](http://vocation.cs.umd.edu/docs/lavi/install.html) 
starting from step 2 for your respective platform (after following prerequisites). 
Anytime `lavi` is in a command replace it with `lava`.
